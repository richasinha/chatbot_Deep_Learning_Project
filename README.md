# chatbot_Deep_Learning_Project
Chatbot project 

This is a part of our Deep Learning Course project where we evaluate two of the neural network based chatbot models. One bing the sequence-sequence model and the other is the Neural Conversation model.

# Testing Seq2Seq

The pre-trained model weights are available in ./working directory of tensorflow_chatbot. To test and play with Seq2Seq just run "execute.py" script in the terminal. [Dependency: Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html), numpy, scipy, six]
# Acknowledgements
We would like to acknowledge the fact that the majority of the code is being reused. We would like to thank the user Conchylicultor for the neural conversation model implementation and the Siraj for his model for the basic seq2seq.
